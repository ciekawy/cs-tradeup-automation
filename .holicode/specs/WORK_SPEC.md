# Work Specification: HoliCode Framework

**Status:** active  
**Created:** 2025-08-04  
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-09  
**Total Context Size:** <2KB (optimized for AI context loading)

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: GitHub is Primary Source
**This file is a LOCAL CACHE of GitHub issue state.**
- GitHub Issues are the single source of truth for all task management
- Run `/github-sync.md` to update this cache from GitHub
- All task creation, updates, and tracking happens in GitHub
- Local specs in `.holicode/specs/` are for technical details only

## Project Overview
AI-assisted development framework with GitHub-driven task management and specification-driven workflows.

## Features (GitHub Epics)
<!-- GitHub Epics linked here by github-sync workflow -->
<!-- Example: - [User Authentication](https://github.com/holagence/holicode/issues/123) -->

## Active Stories (GitHub Issues)
<!-- GitHub Stories linked here by github-sync workflow -->
<!-- Example: - [Login Form](https://github.com/holagence/holicode/issues/124) (Epic: #123) -->

## Current Tasks (GitHub Issues)
<!-- GitHub Tasks linked here by github-sync workflow -->
<!-- Example: - [TASK-001: Implement Auth Service](https://github.com/holagence/holicode/issues/125) (Story: #124) -->

## Technical Design Documents (GitHub Issues & Local Files)
<!-- GitHub TD Issues linked here by github-sync workflow -->
<!-- Example: - [TD-001: System Architecture Overview](https://github.com/holagence/holicode/issues/126) (Local: .holicode/specs/technical-design/TD-001.md) -->

## Implementation Status

```
├── GitHub Epic (Business Value)
│   ├── GitHub Story (User Requirements)
│   │   └── GitHub Task (Implementation Work)
│   │       └── Component SPECs (Live Implementation Specs)
└── GitHub TD Issue (Technical Design)
    └── Local TD File (Detailed Design)
```

## Context Optimization Notes
- **GitHub First**: All tasks are primarily managed in GitHub Issues
- **Local Cache**: This file is a reference cache updated by `/github-sync.md`
- **Component SPECs**: Technical contracts remain co-located with code in `src/**/SPEC.md`
- **Offline Support**: Use `/github-cache.md` for explicit offline work

## Validation Status
- [ ] All chunks validate against .holicode/specs/SCHEMA.md
- [ ] Hierarchical links resolve correctly
- [ ] No orphaned specifications
- [ ] Component SPECs exist for all referenced components

*This manifest is a LOCAL CACHE maintained by HoliCode workflows.*
*GitHub Issues are the PRIMARY source - run `/github-sync.md` to refresh.*
*For offline work, use `/github-cache.md` to cache GitHub data locally.*
