# CS2 Trade-Up Educational Bot

An educational demonstration bot that automates Counter-Strike 2 (CS2) trade-up contracts via Steam Game Coordinator (GC) protocol. This project serves as a research tool to explore trade-up automation mechanics, expected value calculations, and Steam API integration patterns.

## ⚠️ Important Warnings

### Steam Terms of Service Violation

**This project explicitly violates Steam Subscriber Agreement Section 2C**, which prohibits the use of scripts or bots to interact with Steam Content. By using this bot, you accept the following risks:

- **Account Restrictions**: Your Steam account may be restricted, limited, or permanently banned
- **Trade Locks**: Steam may impose trade locks or market restrictions on your account
- **No Warranty**: This software is provided "as-is" with no guarantees or warranties
- **Educational Purpose Only**: This is a research and learning tool, not a commercial trading system

**Use a separate test account with minimal value**. Never use your primary Steam account.

### Not a "Get Rich Quick" Scheme

This bot does **NOT** guarantee profits. CS2 trade-ups involve:
- **High fees**: 15% Steam Community Market fees (plus payment processor fees)
- **Market competition**: Automated traders make manual trading increasingly unprofitable
- **Price volatility**: Market prices change rapidly during 7-day Trade Protection holds
- **Real losses**: Most trade-ups lose money due to fees and market dynamics

This project is designed for **education and research**, not financial gain.

## 🎯 Purpose & Scope

### What This Bot Does

- Demonstrates programmatic CS2 trade-up execution using Node.js libraries
- Explores expected value (EV) calculations and risk modeling
- Validates Steam GC protocol integration without game installation
- Provides learning insights into Steam authentication and inventory management

### What This Bot Does NOT Do

- **Not high-frequency trading**: Human-paced delays (30-300s) to minimize detection risk
- **Not multi-account**: Single account operation only
- **Not guaranteed profit**: Educational tool with no profit promises
- **Not a commercial service**: Self-hosted, personal use only

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: Version 22 or 24 (LTS recommended)
  - Check: `node -v` (should show v22.x.x or v24.x.x)
  - Download: https://nodejs.org/
- **pnpm**: Version 8 or higher
  - Check: `pnpm -v` (should show 8.x.x or higher)
  - Install: `npm install -g pnpm`
- **Docker**: Latest version with docker-compose
  - Check: `docker -v` and `docker-compose -v`
  - Download: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

### Steam Account Requirements

- Steam account with $5+ spent (to remove limited account restrictions)
- Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator enabled (15-day waiting period before trading)
- Steam API Key (obtain from https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)
- **Recommendation**: Use a separate test account, not your primary Steam account

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ciekawy/cs-tradeup-automation.git
cd cs-tradeup-automation
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and fill in your Steam credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your Steam credentials:

```bash
# Steam Authentication (REQUIRED)
STEAM_USERNAME=your_steam_username
STEAM_PASSWORD=your_steam_password
STEAM_SHARED_SECRET=your_shared_secret
STEAM_API_KEY=your_api_key

# Optional Configuration
NODE_ENV=development
LOG_LEVEL=info
MAX_DAILY_CRAFTS=12
MAX_MONTHLY_CRAFTS=100
CRAFT_DELAY_MIN=300000  # 5 minutes
CRAFT_DELAY_MAX=900000  # 15 minutes
```

**Security Note**: Never commit `.env` to version control. It contains sensitive credentials.

### 4. Run Locally (Development)

```bash
# Run tests
pnpm test

# Build TypeScript
pnpm build

# Start the bot
pnpm start
```

### 5. Run with Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Build the Docker image
pnpm docker:build
# OR
docker-compose build

# Start the bot in detached mode
pnpm docker:up
# OR
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f bot

# Stop the bot
pnpm docker:down
# OR
docker-compose down
```

## 🐳 Docker Usage

### Development Mode with Hot-Reload

The docker-compose configuration includes hot-reload for development:

```bash
# Start with hot-reload enabled
docker-compose up

# Make changes to src/ or tests/ - container will reload automatically
```

### Container Management

```bash
# View running containers
docker-compose ps

# Access container shell
docker-compose exec bot sh

# View logs (last 100 lines)
docker-compose logs --tail=100 bot

# Restart container
docker-compose restart bot

# Rebuild after dependency changes
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

### Persistent Data

The bot stores session tokens and state in a persistent Docker volume:

- **Volume**: `bot-data` mounted at `/data` in container
- **Contents**: `session.json`, `volume.json`, `trade_queue.json`, logs
- **Backup**: `docker run --rm -v bot-data:/data -v $(pwd):/backup alpine tar czf /backup/bot-data-backup.tar.gz /data`

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite to verify your setup:

```bash
# Run all tests once
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Generate coverage report
pnpm test:coverage

# Run linting
pnpm lint

# Auto-fix linting issues
pnpm lint:fix
```
